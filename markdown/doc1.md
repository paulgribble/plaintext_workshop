# Abstract

"Blade Runners" at the LAPD administer the Voight-Kampff test to
individuals for the purposes of identifying replicants. The test
measures several physiological parameters such as respiration and
heart rates, eye movements and blushing responses in the context of
emotionally provocative questions. In the studies described here we
evaluate whether this test can successfully identify Nexus-6 model
replicants (Tyrell Corporation).

# Introduction

In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex-police officer Rick Deckard
(Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and
brought to his former supervisor, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Deckard,
whose job as a "Blade Runner" was to track down bioengineered beings
known as replicants and "retire" (a euphemism for killing) them, is
informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation
Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come
to Earth to try to extend their lives.

## The Video

Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering
the "Voight-Kampff" test designed to distinguish replicants from
humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test
subject, Leon (Brion James), shoots Holden after Holden asks about
Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three
replicants: Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Pris
(Daryl Hannah). Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant
ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.

Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure
that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that
Dr. Eldon Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) assistant Rachael (Sean Young) is an
experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has
been given false memories to provide an "emotional cushion". As a
result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is
a replicant.

## The Search for Replicants

Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the
replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend
their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing
laboratory and learn of J. F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), a gifted
genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard
at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo,
but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's
niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates
Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

While searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and
a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora
works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also
retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After
Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, but Rachael
kills Leon using Deckard's dropped pistol. The two return to Deckard's
apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt
her; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard physically restrains her,
forcing her to kiss him.

## Sebastian's apartment

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are
dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of
"Methuselah Syndrome", a genetic premature aging disorder, his life
will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's
secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell
tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done
"questionable things" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced
design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then
kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then
rides the elevator down alone. Though not shown, it is implied by
Bryant via police radio that Roy also kills Sebastian.

Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but
he manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy starts to die, he
chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard
tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but misses and is left hanging
precariously between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as
Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As
Roy's life runs out, he delivers a monologue about how his memories
"will be lost like tears in rain"; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who
watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard, "It's too
bad she won't live, but then again, who does?" Deckard returns to his
apartment and finds the door ajar, but Rachael is safe, asleep in his
bed. As they leave, Deckard notices a small tin-foil origami unicorn
on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff's
final words. Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block.
